                    <p>Attention: It is worth remembering that it is extremely important to save the information obtained in the recognition phase in a notepad, as you can be sure that you will use it later on.</p>
                    <p>Hypothetically, consider that we are targeting the website https://www.tango.com/ and we want to perform reconnaissance on this target, finding subdomains, important directories, files, social networks, and publicly accessible information. This phase is of utmost importance as it will define how and where our possible entry points will be.</p>
                    <p>We have two paths to follow, passive or aggressive reconnaissance. We will always start by using the passive path, as we do not want to alert the target about our presence and intentions.</p>
                    <p>In this endeavor, your best ally will be Google and/or other search engines, either to find other sites that perform target reconnaissance or to conduct advanced searches yourself.</p>
                    <p>I will talk more about Google, as it is the most common and famous, but below you will find documentation for other search engines.</p>

                    <p>The most common search engine for advanced searches is Google, along with a famous technique called Google Hacking. Below are some examples of Google dorks that we can use to obtain some information.</p>

                    <p>
                        By directing our reconnaissance towards gathering valuable information about subdomains, we can take advantage of the resources of the <a href="https://crt.sh/">https://crt.sh/</a> website. This website offers a unique service that allows us to delve into the information on our tango's SSL certificate. By doing so, we can discover any domains that are directly associated with their certificate.

                    <h3>[ dnsrecon ]</h3>
                    <p>
                        When we talk about dns, the first tool that should come to mind is dnsrecon; with this tool, we can do all kinds of domain listing, from searches on bing, yandex, crt.sh, to even brute force dictionaries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As mentioned above, you can also use the dnsrecon tool to query crt.sh. I prefer to use dnsrecon for its simplicity and practicality, rather than the website.

                        We can use Wappalyzer to find out which front/back-end frameworks the target is running on that site. This is simple information, but it will be useful in our future goals, as it will allow us to test for another range of vulnerabilities.

                    <p>Wappalyzer is a browser extension, available for download from the Google Chrome and Firefox stores.</p>
                    <p>
                        This extremely useful extension returns data such as the server's operating system, system version, page programming language and so on.
