<b>:: [1] Introduction</b>

<p class="paragraph">The Pyramid of Pain is a famous conceptual tool in the field of cybersecurity. It helps security teams understand and prioritize the threats they face. In this paper, we will explore three main components of the pyramid: Hash Values, IP Addresses and Domain Names.</p>

<b>:: [2] Hash Values</b>

<p class="paragraph">Hash values ​​are at the base of the pain pyramid. They are relatively easy to change and therefore don't cause much "pain" to attackers when they are discovered and blocked. However, even though they are low-level, they are still useful for detecting malicious activity, especially when combined with other information.</p>

<b>:: [3] IP Addresses</b>

<p class="paragraph">IP addresses are one step above hash values ​​in the pyramid. IP addresses can provide information about the attacker's geographic location as well as the infrastructure used in the attack. However, just like hash values, IP addresses can also be easily changed or disguised by attackers.</p>

<b>:: [4] Domain Names</b>

<p class="paragraph">Domain names are even higher up the pyramid and are more difficult to change than hash values ​​and IP addresses. Attackers often register their own domains to use in attacks, so discovering and blocking a malicious domain name can cause a significant amount of "pain" to the attacker.</p>

<b>:: [5] Conclusion</b>

<p class="paragraph">The Pyramid of Pain is a valuable tool for cybersecurity teams as it helps prioritize defensive actions based on the level of "pain" each action will cause to the attacker. By understanding the components of the pyramid, security teams can craft more effective and focused strategies to protect their systems and data.</p>
