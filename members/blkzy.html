<p class="paragraph">Hi, my name is Matheus and i'm 22 years old.</p>
<p class="paragraph">I've been in the hacking field since 2018, but in 2021 I had to take
a break, and I'm back now in 2024 focused on the blue team and intelligence.</p>
<p class="paragraph">My intention here is to share what little knowledge I have,
and also to help myself with writing texts.</p>

My projects:

- <a href="https://github.com/blkzy/wpreconx">wpreconx</a> (archived) 
<p class="paragraph">   This is a tool for collecting information and scanning WordPress sites.</p>
<p class="paragraph">   I started developing it to be an alternative to wpscan, but totally free.
   In the middle of the development process, I had to make it private
   due to its military use for detecting internal vulnerabilities.
</p>

- <a href="https://github.com/blkzy/apkronx">apkronx</a> (archived)
<p class="paragraph">   This was an epiphany of an idea related to the exploration of
   mobile applications, both Android (APK) and iOS (IPA).</p>
<p class="paragraph">   I simply got bored and decided to shelve the project, but in
   the future I intend to resurrect it and continue its development.</p>

- <a href="https://github.com/4forward-secure">spectrum</a> (developing)
<p class="paragraph">   This is my latest project, designed to collect information from
   the social networks of specific tangoes. The idea is to define
   a tango and set Spectrum to follow its life on social networks
   in real time.</p>
<p class="paragraph">   I thought of it to exercise my code writing skills in Python,
   Golang and also to improve my database skills.</p>
